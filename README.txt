Matlab version of the 6 para ABM to simulate BFR induced by 10 protocols in young animals and by 7 protocols in old animals.  

The ABM and its findings are as published in PloS Computational Biology (see paper in the repo, and the online version of the open source paper also includes a downloadable c++ version of the matlab program).

To perform simulations, execute (or run)  the “RT_6para_ParaAltered_YO.m” program.  If you want to test the effect of setting specific parameters to be the same between young and old, specify the parameter number in the interactive question asked when the program is run.

Contact lead author if you would like access to the version of the program where parameters are calibrated via simulated annealing.
